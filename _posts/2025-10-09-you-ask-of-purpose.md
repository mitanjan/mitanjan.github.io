You ask of purpose and I tell you the purpose i.e Knowing what is at the boundary of the universe or is there even a boundary? What is beyond that boundary? Is there an end? How is it made? Is there any creator? Who wrote the laws of its working? Why are we here and for what? Can we write our own laws? Can we bend them? Are we inside something and trapped? Is there a way out? What is the outside? Consciousness of higher dimensions? Will we ever know thyself?
